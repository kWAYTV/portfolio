# The Great Coffee-to-Code Ratio Crisis

Every developer knows productivity is directly proportional to the amount of
coffee consumed. But how much is too much? And what happens when you run out?

## The Scientific Method

```typescript
function productivity(cupsOfCoffee: number) {
  if (cupsOfCoffee === 0) return 'Why am I even here?';
  if (cupsOfCoffee < 3) return 'Warming up...';
  if (cupsOfCoffee < 6) return 'Code is flying, bugs are dying!';
  if (cupsOfCoffee < 10) return 'I can see sounds and hear colors';
  return 'I have achieved quantum debugging. Also, my hands are shaking.';
}
```

## The Developer's Morning Ritual

1. Open laptop.
2. Open IDE.
3. Open Slack.
4. Open existential dread.
5. Realize you forgot coffee.
6. Close existential dread, open coffee.

## The Side Effects

```bash
$ git commit -m "fix: actually fix the bug this time"
$ git push
# Realizes it was the wrong branch
$ git revert HEAD
# Realizes it was the right branch, but the wrong bug
$ git blame coffee
```

## The Office Coffee Machine

- 9:00 AM: Full pot, hope in the air.
- 10:00 AM: Lukewarm, questionable.
- 11:00 AM: Tastes like burnt rubber and broken dreams.
- 2:00 PM: Someone made tea. The betrayal.

## The Real Productivity Hack

```typescript
// The secret to shipping on time
function shipFeature() {
  const coffee = fetchCoffee();
  if (!coffee) throw new Error('Feature delayed: Out of coffee');
  return 'Deployed to production (probably)';
}
```

## Conclusion

Remember: behind every successful deploy is a developer who's 80% caffeine, 20%
imposter syndrome. If you see me staring blankly at my screen, don't worryâ€”I'm
just compiling. Or maybe I need more coffee.

P.S. If this post has typos, blame the coffee. Or the lack thereof.
