# Guess Less, Log More

If you're debugging by vibes, your app deserves better. Before you tweak code,
add a few good logs and let reality answer faster than hunches.

## What to log (briefly)

- Inputs and outputs (sanitized)
- Branch decisions (which path ran)
- External calls with duration
- Errors with context (who/what/when)

```ts
// Minimal, useful, boringly effective
const startedAt = performance.now();
const response = await fetch(url, opts);

console.log('http.fetch', {
  url,
  status: response.status,
  ms: Math.round(performance.now() - startedAt)
});
```

## Micro-rules that pay off

- Log structure, not prose (objects > strings)
- Include identifiers, not payloads (avoid PII)
- One log per boundary: input, decision, output

```json
{ "op": "signup", "stage": "decision", "exists": true, "ms": 12 }
```

## Takeaway

Five lines of logging beat fifty minutes of guessing. Ship the logs, then ship
the fix.
