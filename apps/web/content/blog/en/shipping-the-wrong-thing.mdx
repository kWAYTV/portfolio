title: Shipping the Wrong Thing
description: Sometimes the right move is to ship the feature nobody asked for and see what happens

I spent a week on a feature. Clean API, typed everywhere, tests passing. Shipped it.

Nobody used it.

Not in a "we'll get to it" way. In a "the button is right there and they click everything else" way. I checked the analytics. The endpoint was never hit. The UI flow was never completed. It was just… there.

## The post-mortem I didn't write

I could tell myself the usual stories. Bad placement. Wrong timing. Needed more marketing. Maybe. Or maybe I solved a problem I had, not one anyone else had. The code was fine. The problem was the wrong one.

## What I did instead

Left it in. Didn't rip it out. Didn't add a banner saying "NEW: try this." Just left it. A few months later someone asked how to do the thing. I pointed at the feature. They used it. Then two more people. No fanfare. It just started being the way that thing gets done.

So now I don't know if the lesson is "ship and wait" or "ship and fail quietly" or "your users don't read the changelog." Probably all three.

## The other wrong thing

There's another feature I'm pretty sure is wrong. Different product, same instinct. I'm building it anyway. Either it'll sit there unused and I'll have another story like this one, or it won't. The only way to find out is to put it in front of people and stop guessing.

That's the part that still feels weird. Shipping something you're not sure about. Not as a beta or an experiment—just as the next version. No opt-in. No feature flag. It's there. If it's wrong, we'll know.

*What did you ship that nobody used—and did it ever find its people later?*
