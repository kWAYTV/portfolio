title: The Side Project Graveyard
description: A guided tour through my unfinished projects and the lies I told myself

Every developer has a folder. You know the one.

`~/projects`, `~/code`, `~/dev`. Maybe even `~/definitely-finishing-this-one`.

It's where side projects go to die.

## The residents

Let me introduce you to some of mine:

### 1. The "I'll build my own X" projects

- A custom note-taking app (because Notion wasn't enough)
- A habit tracker (used it for 3 days)
- A personal finance dashboard (ironic, given I spent money on domains for it)

Status: Last commit 8 months ago. README says "coming soon."

### 2. The tutorial graveyard

Half-finished courses. Abandoned YouTube series. That one Udemy purchase from 2019.

I have 47% of a Rust CLI somewhere. It prints "Hello" but not "World." Close enough.

### 3. The "this will make me rich" ideas

A SaaS that solves a problem nobody has. Complete with:
- Landing page ✓
- Waitlist form ✓
- Actual product ✗

The waitlist has 3 signups. All me. Testing.

### 4. The over-engineered todo app

Every developer's rite of passage. Mine has:
- GraphQL API
- Kubernetes config
- CI/CD pipeline
- WebSocket real-time sync

It cannot mark a task as complete. That feature is "in the backlog."

## Why do they die?

Same reasons every time:

1. **New shiny thing** - Started learning Go, abandoned the Python project
2. **Scope creep** - "What if it also did meal planning?"
3. **The 80% wall** - Core features done, but auth and deployment are boring
4. **Life** - Work got busy, touched grass, forgot what the code did

## The lies we tell

- "I'll come back to this"
- "The code is self-documenting"
- "I remember exactly where I left off"
- "This is a learning experience" (it was, but still)

## Should you feel bad?

No.

Every abandoned project taught you something. That Rust CLI taught me lifetimes. The SaaS taught me that I hate writing landing page copy. The todo app taught me that Kubernetes is overkill for everything.

The graveyard isn't failure. It's a museum of curiosity.

## The plot twist

This blog? Also a side project.

Check back in 6 months to see if it joins the others.
