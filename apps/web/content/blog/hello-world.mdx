Every developer blog starts the same way: "I'm finally starting a blog!"

Then silence. For months. Sometimes years.

## Why this time is different

It's not. I'll probably abandon this too. But at least I'm honest about it.

## The plan

1. Write when I actually have something to say
2. Keep it short (you're welcome)
3. No "10 reasons why X will change your life" posts
4. Maybe share some code that took me embarrassingly long to figure out

## Tech stack

Because what's a dev blog without mentioning the stack:

- Next.js 16
- Fumadocs for the blog
- Deployed on Vercel
- Written at 3am probably

See you in 6 months for post #2. Or tomorrow. Who knows.
