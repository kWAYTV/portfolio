Finally got around to setting up a blog. No promises on posting frequency.

## Why?

Mostly to document things I learn and build. Writing helps me think, and maybe it'll help someone else too.

## What to expect

- Short posts about code, tools, and random discoveries
- Project breakdowns when I ship something interesting
- The occasional rant about developer experience

That's it. Let's see where this goes.
